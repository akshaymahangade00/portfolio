            <center><h2>Number Guessing Game</h2></center>
           <center><p> <b>Project Description:</b> <br></center> 

               <br> <b>Objective: </b> <br>
                The objective of this project is to create a simple number guessing game in JavaScript. The game will generate a random number, and the player will have to guess that number within a limited number of attempts.
                
              <br> <b>Features:</b>  <br>
                
                <b>Random Number Generation:</b> 
               <br>The game should generate a random number between a specified range (e.g., 1 to 100) at the beginning of each game.
                
                <br> <b>User Interaction: </b>
                <br>The player should be able to input their guesses into the program.
                
               <br> <b>Feedback:</b> 
               <br>After each guess, the program should provide feedback to the player, indicating whether their guess was too high, too low, or correct.
                
              <br> <b>Attempts Limit: </b> 
              <br>The game should limit the number of attempts the player can make (e.g., 10 attempts).
                
               <br> <b>Win/Lose Condition: </b>
               <br> The game should determine if the player has won by guessing the correct number within the allowed attempts or lost if they exhaust all their attempts.
                
               <br> <b>Play Again Option: </b>
               <br> After a game concludes (win or lose), the player should have the option to play again.
                
               <br> <b>Implementation Steps: </b>
               <br>
                
                Initialize the game by generating a random number within the specified range.
                Ask the player for their first guess.
                Check if the guess is correct, too high, or too low and provide feedback.
                Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the player guesses correctly or exhausts all attempts.
                If the player wins, congratulate them and display the number of attempts taken.
                If the player loses, reveal the correct number and encourage them to play again.
                Ask the player if they want to play another round. If yes, repeat the game with a new random number. If no, exit the program.
               <br>
